# SuperSimple

Pelican theme as simple as it can be. Based on a lot of other themes and ideas.

# pelicanconf.py
```
THEME = 'supersimple'
FAVICON = 'name_of_your_favicon.png'
PROFILE_IMAGE = 'profile.jpeg' (Image that it'll be shown throughout your blog)
INTRO = 'Description you like' (Description of your blog)
```

# Social Settings

** Note **
Supersimple theme uses the key of the tuple to print the icon. In case the icon
your trying to use doesn't work, please check [here](https://iconmonstr.com/iconicfont) to see if it's available.

```
SOCIAL_TUPLE = (
    ('icon', 'name', 'link'), 
)

SOCIAL_TUPLE = (
    ('github', 'Github', 'https://github.com/yourname'), 
)
```
